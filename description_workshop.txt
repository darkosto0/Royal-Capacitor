The Royal Capacitor mod adds one and only item, the Royal Capacitor.
It is a Risk of Rain 2 Item that summons a lightning strike on the nearest enemy to the cursor, dealing 3000% damage of your currently held weapon

Along that, this mod adds a special accesory slot meant just for equipment, as i plan on expanding this mod and hopefully adding all equipment from RoR2
